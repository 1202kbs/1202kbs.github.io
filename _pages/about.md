I'm currently a 3rd grade Mathematics major undergraduate at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. My research interests lie  in the intersection of generalization, adversarial robustness, and interpretability in machine learning. I also believe that some day, mathematics will provide us with a unified theory of deep learning, which will allow us to understand the behavior of deep neural networks in a rigorous manner.
