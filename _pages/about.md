My name is Beomsu Kim, and I'm currently a first year graduate student majoring in Mathematical Sciences at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). My research goal is to understand deep learning through the lens of mathematics. Until I get my degree, I aim to become fluent at expressing my thoughts using optimization theory, probability theory, and statistics.
