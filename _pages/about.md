I'm currently a 3rd grade Mathematics major undergraduate at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. My research interests lie  in the intersection of generalization, adversarial robustness, and interpretability in machine learning. I also believe that some day, mathematics will provide us with a unified theory of deep learning, which will allow us to understand the behavior of deep neural networks in a rigorous manner.

So far, I have taken lectures in

* Vector Calculus (*Vector Calculus* by Susan J. Colley)
* Probability and Statistics (*Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists* by Sheldon M. Ross)
* Linear Algebra (*Linear Algebra* by Kenneth M. Hoffman and Ray Kunze)
* Basic Analysis (*Principles of Mathematical Analysis* by Walter Rudin)
* Basic Discrete Mathematics (*Invitation to Discrete Mathematics* by Jiri Matousek and Jaroslav Nesetril)
* Mathematical Statistics (*Statistical Inference* by George Casella and Roger L. Berger)
* Group Theory (*Abstract Algebra* by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote)
* General Topology (Lecture notes written by the professor)
* Numerical Analysis (*Numerical Analysis* by Richard L. Burden and J. Douglas Faires)
* Basic Probability Theory (*Basic Probability Theory* by Robert B. Ash)
* Optimization Theory (*Optimization Models* by Giuseppe C. Calafiore and Laurent El Ghaoui)
* Lebesgue Integral Theory (*Real Analysis for Graduate Students* by Richard F. Bass)
* Basic Machine Learning (Lecture notes written by the professor)

and I want / plan to study

* Probability Theory (*Probability: Theory and Examples* by Rick Durrett)
* Functional Analysis (*Functional Analysis: An Introduction* by Yuli Eidelman et al.)
* Ring, Module, and Field Theory (*Abstract Algebra* by David S. Dummit and Richard M. Foote)
* Algebraic Topology (*Algebraic Topology* by Allen Hatcher)
* Algebraic Geometry (*An Invitation to Algebraic Geometry* by Karen E. Smith et al.)
* Differential Geometry (*Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces* by Manfredo P. Do Carmo)
* Manifold Theory (*An Introduction to Manifolds* by Loring W. Tu)
* Riemannian Geometry (*Introduction to Riemannian Manifolds* by John M. Lee)
* Category Theory (*Categories for the Working Mathematician* by Saunders Mac Lane)
* Machine Learning, Statistical Learning, Deep Learning, etc.
